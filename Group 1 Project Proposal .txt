Group 1 Project Proposal 

today we'll decide on an area of interest, team members, project proposal with question, expected outcome, data to be used. 

Team Members: LaTaya Franklin, Richard Willet, Ellen Grant, Sarah Racine, Natalie Raver-Goldsby. 

Project Proposal: Comparing real estate prices and mortgage rates over the last 20 years in the Nashville metro area. 
1) What is the strongest determining factor of real estate prices? 
2) Does the strength of these effects differ for different types of real estate/different listings (1br vs 3br, single family homes, condos, etc) 
3) How do different types of real estate (e.g., residential, commercial) respond to changes in mortgage rates? 
4) What role do other economic indicators (unemployment rates, income levels, and inflation) play in this relationship? 
5) How do mortgage rate changes impact different segments of the population?

Datasets we plan to use: 
Census Data

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/real-estate-sales-2001-2021-gl

Expected outcome: 
Define a trend of expected real estate prices vs what the market/mortgage rate prices are. Expecting a negative relationship, as mortgage rates increase, we expect real estate prices to decrease. 
1) We expect mortgage rates to be the strongest determining factor of real estate prices.
